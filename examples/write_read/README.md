# write_to_file.py and read_from_file.py: File Management Scripts

These are two Python scripts, `write_to_file.py` and `read_from_file.py`, that work together to manage file content.

## **write_to_file.py**

This script allows you to write content to a specified file. It performs basic validation on the filename and content before writing.

### **Key functionalities:**

* Validates the filename (raises an error for empty filenames).
* Validates the content (currently checks for emptiness and basic allowed characters, you can replace this with your desired validation logic).
* Writes the validated content to the specified file.
* Provides feedback messages on success or encountered errors.

### **Usage:**

```
python write_to_file.py <filename> <content>
```

**Example:**

```
python write_to_file.py my_file.txt "Hello, world!"
```

This will create a file named `my_file.txt` and write the content "Hello, world!" to it, assuming the content validation passes.

## **read_from_file.py**

This script allows you to read the content of a file and compare it with provided content.

### **Key functionalities:**

* Validates the filename and the content provided as arguments (raises an error for empty filenames or content).
* Reads the content of the specified file.
* Compares the read content with the provided content.
* Provides feedback messages indicating whether the content matches or not.

### **Usage:**

```
python read_from_file.py <filename> <content>
```

**Example:**

```
python read_from_file.py my_file.txt "Hello, world!"
```

This will read the content of `my_file.txt` and compare it with the string "Hello, world!". If they match, it will print a success message. Otherwise, it will indicate a mismatch.

## **Interaction between Scripts:**

* You can use `write_to_file.py` to write content to a file.
* Then, you can use `read_from_file.py` with the same filename and the written content to verify if the writing was successful.
